# My Rachel
*My Rachel* is a Twine adventure that revolves around two figures: Rachel MacCormack--a beloved young woman who died in a mysterious car accident--and a mysterious figure who obsesses over the last night of her life. Taking the role of this unstable would-be paramour, the player uses his strange shapeshifting abilities to worm his way into the secrets that cling to the seemingly peaceful small town of Floyd River, and ultimately uncovers a disturbing truth that waits just below the churning water.
